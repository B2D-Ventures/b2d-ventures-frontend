# Project Installation Guide

Welcome to the B2D project! This guide will help you set up your development environment and get the application up and running.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 12.22.0 or later)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **Yarn**

You can check if you have Node.js and npm installed by running:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## Installation Steps

Follow these steps to set up your Next.js project:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   If you haven't already, clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/B2D-Ventures/b2d-ventures-frontend.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd b2d-ventures-frontend
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Use npm or Yarn to install the project dependencies:

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

4. **Run the Development Server**

   Start the development server to see your application in action:

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Or using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

   Your application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Additional Commands

Here are some additional commands you might find useful:

- **Build the Application**

   To create an optimized production build, run:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   Or with Yarn:
